This is a website for an artifiicial cruise company called "TravelTheSea" to promote online uses too visit their "Official Website"
The website provides the neccessary information such as the different destinations, prices, deals offered by the company and a contact section for the customer to feedback. 
For the home page "index.html" I wanted the slogan of the company to be the first thing they see when visiting. There are 2 primary call-to-action (CTA) that they will see and that is the "Visit Website" and "Watch a video". Clicking the first CTA would bring them to the Royal Carribean website while clicking the second CTA would bring them to a Youtube AD for cruises.
For mobile, there would be a hamburger menu at the top right hand side of the website. Clicking it would show a drop down menu of the nav bar
The next section is a features section to summarise what the cruise has to provide aboard. I set the background image as a picture of the cruise on sea to not make the website dull and boring.
The final section of the home page features a review section given by previous customers of the cruise. The reviews are taken from real cruise website, but the picture of the person is not real. The review are shown in a container on a background of a cruise.

Going to the second page "destinations.html" I have many containers that are meant for different destinations. The containers have different background depending on their destination. The container would also have a list of the popular attraction from that particular destination. making it nice and colorful would attract online users' attention. at the end of the page, I have included a small CTA to direct users to the "Official Website" if clicked.

For the next page, "pricing.html" titled as "Deals". It showcases the different deals provided by the company. The header is big and bold to attract the users' attention. The containers all have different background to make the page more lively. And each container would show the different prices and name of the deals. At the bottom of the page, the same CTA is provided to direct users to "Official Website" 

The Contact Section -"contact.html" is a simple page which shows 2 forms, labelled under "Name" and "Message" and a button "Send Message". This allow users to provide their feedback or enquiries to the company. On the right, a map is provided to show the location of the company's headquarter.

For the final page "purchase.html". I misunderstood and made a "E-commerce website" which was not what is required. This page was to allow transaction to take place. And I decided to leave the page as it is, simply designed to show the tickets' details bought by users.
